## Design Decisions
The following points state the decisions I made in the design of the application and the reason for each.

* Where applicable, I represented prices with the non-primitive data type, _**BigDecimal**_, for the reason that the ability to handle an infinitely long precision of values accurately is of more importance than performance, since we are dealing with a financial application. _**Float**_ and _**Double**_ both come short in this.
